# Lesson 1
>>> Using the script [blink_modified.ino](https://github.com/JawaTradingCo/Arduino/blob/master/Lesson%201/blink_modified.ino) and the provided mini breadboard and leds, wire up and program the arduino to alternate and blink three different LEDs. The colors are not important. An example working simulation can be found at [TinkerCard](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/deh4Cn99iYP-zach-lesson-1).

Things to Remember:
1. Cathode is Negative - it goes to ground
2. Anode is Positive + it goes to the output pin
3. Don't ever connect + directly to -
4. If it doesn't work, part of the journey here is figuring out why. I know this circuit works, the simulation proves it. So when it doesn't work, figure out why. Troubleshoot wisely. Only one LED works? Examine it and figure out what you did wrong with the others? Can't get three to work at once? Try one at a time.
5. I encourage you to type the code in instead of copying and pasting.
6. Stuck? Google first, then ask me.
7. Once you get it to work, mess around with the code and try to make it do different things. The assignment is considered a success as long as three LED's light up in any pattern or order.
